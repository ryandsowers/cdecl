# cdecl
writing functions that utilize the C calling convention (cdecl), and packaging those functions together to create a library of functions

implement all of the functions utilizing only assembly language.
contributed code may make system calls using 'syscall', but it may not call any functions 
that you have not written yourself. Your code will be evaluated based on its interoperability 
with the instructorâ€™s main.c. Once complete, link your file together with start.o and main.o to 
create a 64-bit Linux executable.
